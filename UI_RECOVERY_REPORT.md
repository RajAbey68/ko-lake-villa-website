- Updated Tailwind config with comprehensive safelist

## Tailwind Safelist Protection

Added extensive safelist to prevent CSS purging:
```typescript
safelist: [
  // Color patterns for all common colors
  { pattern: /(bg|text|border)-(amber|orange|slate|white|black|gray|green|blue|red|yellow|emerald)-(50-900)/ },
  // Grid and spacing utilities
  { pattern: /(grid-cols|col-span|row-span)-\d+/ },
  { pattern: /gap-(0-24)/ },
  { pattern: /(p|m|px|py|mx|my|mt|mb|ml|mr)-(0-24)/ },
  // Common component classes
  'card', 'btn', 'btn-primary', 'btn-outline',
  'hero', 'hero-content', 'hero-overlay',
  // And more...
]
```

## E2E Test Coverage

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Added `e2e-vercel-preview.yml`:
- Runs automatically on Vercel preview deployments
- Tests the preview URL with Playwright
- Uploads test reports as artifacts
- Prevents broken UI from reaching production

## Known Issues

1. **Gallery Page**: Times out during build (pre-existing issue)
2. **Firebase**: Running in fallback mode (no env vars configured)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create PR**:
   ```bash
   # Go to:
   https://github.com/RajAbey68/ko-lake-villa-website/pull/new/fix/recover-guestypro-home
   ```

2. **Wait for Vercel Preview**:
   - Vercel will create a preview deployment
   - Share the preview URL for verification
   - E2E tests will run automatically

3. **After Verification**:
   - Merge the PR
   - In Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy Production
   - Enable "Clear build cache" option

### Vercel Configuration

1. **Set Production Branch**:
   - Go to Vercel → Settings → Git

   ```

3. **Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm ci`

### GitHub Branch Protection

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main`
