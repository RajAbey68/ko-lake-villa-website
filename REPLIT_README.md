# Replit Instructions (Please Read)

- This app is **Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind**. **Do not** change frameworks.
- Start command already runs `npm ci` to keep versions locked.
- If you need to modify architecture, you must obtain **architecture-approved** label.
- Deleting/renaming `app/**` or `components/**` will fail CI without approval.

Thank you!
