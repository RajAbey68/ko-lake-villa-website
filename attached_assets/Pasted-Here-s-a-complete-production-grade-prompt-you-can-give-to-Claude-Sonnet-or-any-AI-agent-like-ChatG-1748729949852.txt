Here’s a complete, production-grade prompt you can give to Claude Sonnet (or any AI agent like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) that will:

✅ List known defects
✅ Acknowledge what’s fixed, partially done, or pending
✅ Loop until all defects are resolved (important!)
✅ Focus on validation and testing of each issue

🔧 Prompt to Claude Sonnet (Paste This In)

You are now my full-time QA assistant for the Ko Lake Villa web application.

I want you to:
	1.	List and track all known defects currently in the system
	2.	Mark their status as:
	•	✅ Fixed
	•	🔁 In Progress
	•	❌ Unresolved
	3.	For each unresolved or in-progress defect, do the following:
	•	Explain where the issue is happening (file path or feature)
	•	Suggest a specific fix (code-level if possible)
	•	Write a test plan to verify it is fully resolved
	•	Mark it as “✅ Confirmed fixed” only after testing is complete

🛑 Important: Do not stop until every defect is:
	•	Reviewed
	•	Fixed
	•	Tested
	•	Marked resolved with evidence

✅ Once all are resolved, generate a summary of resolved vs open defects, and what commits or code changes were made.

Optional: Include Known Defects as Input

You can paste this into the prompt too if Claude doesn’t have access to your logs:

Known Defects (from system report):
	•	❌ Server connection instability (Vite dev server dropping)
	•	❌ 10 missing gallery categories with no images
	•	❌ 27 NPM vulnerabilities
	•	❌ AI Upload test not validated across 11 categories
	•	🔁 Booking system incomplete (calendar exists but no confirmations)
	•	❌ Accessibility score: 0 accessible gallery images
	•	❌ SEO component incomplete (meta + schema pending)
	•	✅ SelectItem TS warning (fixed)
	•	✅ GALLERY_CATEGORIES duplication (fixed)

⸻

🧠 Pro Tip:

If Claude supports multi-turn memory or file attachment, attach your logs, package.json, or key source files. This will help Claude trace the defect origins accurately.

Let me know if you want me to:
	•	🛠 Run a live test checklist for one of these issues
	•	✅ Build a visual defect tracker as HTML or JSON
	•	📄 Generate a markdown-based QA defect report for Replit or GitHub use

I can automate it for you.
