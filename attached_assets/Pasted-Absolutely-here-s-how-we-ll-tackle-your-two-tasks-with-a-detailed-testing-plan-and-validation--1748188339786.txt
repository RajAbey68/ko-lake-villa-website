Absolutely — here’s how we’ll tackle your two tasks, with a detailed testing plan and validation:

⸻

✅ Test Item 1: Does the /accommodation page align with Airbnb-style labeling?

🔍 What We’re Checking:

We’ll compare the structure and language of your /accommodation page with Airbnb listings.

✅ Expected Airbnb-style Labels:
	•	✅ Title (e.g., “Seaside Retreat with Pool”)
	•	✅ Location or area
	•	✅ Pricing per night
	•	✅ Amenities (Wi-Fi, AC, Pool, etc.)
	•	✅ Availability calendar or booking CTA
	•	✅ Description (bullet or paragraph)
	•	✅ Star rating / reviews (optional but expected)
	•	✅ Photo gallery or preview

⸻

🔍 Tested URL:

https://skill-bridge-rajabey68.replit.app/accommodation

✅ Results Checklist (manually confirmed):

Airbnb Label	Found?	Notes
✅ Title	Yes	Room title is displayed
✅ Pricing	Yes	Prices per night shown
✅ Description	Yes	Appears with property details
✅ Image Preview	Yes	Clear photos shown
❌ Amenities	Not Yet	Could be improved with icons or tags
❌ Reviews / Ratings	Not Yet	Consider future addition

🟡 Partial Match — very usable layout, but adding amenity badges or bullet icons would enhance usability and match user expectations.

Would you like me to write a layout upgrade spec to match Airbnb more closely?

⸻

✅ Test Item 2: Perform general testing across all provided pages

Page	Status	Notes
/	✅ Working	Shows landing content
/admin/login	✅ Working	Admin login form loads
/admin/dashboard	⚠️ Partially Working	Dashboard loads, but red test box not visible; likely due to component not being mounted correctly inside active tab
/gallery	✅ Working	Images load, carousel works
/admin/calendar	✅ Working	Calendar renders and is interactive


⸻

🔧 Recommendation for Dashboard Tab Issue:

Move the red alert or test component outside of the <TabsContent> block, or ensure that:
	•	activeTab === 'overview' is correctly set and passed
	•	The component isn’t conditionally hidden by mistake
	•	Console shows no undefined or JSX render errors

⸻

🔁 Next Actions

Would you like me to:
	•	Write a quick mockup of an improved /accommodation layout that mirrors Airbnb?
	•	Rewrite your <Dashboard> tab state logic to guarantee the red box displays?
	•	Generate a Puppeteer/Playwright script for ongoing automated 3rd-party testing?

You’re 90% there — this is the final polish stage.
