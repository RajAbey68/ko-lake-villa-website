Thanks for the clear screenshot — you’re absolutely right to be concerned. Airbnb is applying dynamic discounts (possibly promotional rules or proximity-based price drops), which means the rate your Replit site uses as “base” could be out of sync with what guests actually see.

🧠 Can We Extract Airbnb’s Actual Best Price?

❌ No public API for Airbnb hosts

Airbnb does not provide a public API to fetch live prices unless you are an approved PMS or OTA partner.

⸻

✅ But Here’s What You Can Do Instead

🛠 Option 1: Manual Price Sync via Admin Panel
	1.	Once per week (e.g., every Sunday), extract these weekday rates:
	•	Sunday – Tuesday (baseline pricing strategy)
	2.	Log them manually or via Google Sheet → Replit JSON
	3.	Your smart pricing logic will reference these updated baselines

We can even build a price input panel into your admin dashboard so a team member can update just 3 fields:

{
  "knp": 431,
  "knp1": 119,
  "knp3": 70
}

🧠 Option 2: Use a PMS Platform with API Access

PMS	Sync with Airbnb	API Available	Bubble/Replit Compatible
Lodgify	✅	✅	Yes (Zapier/API/Webhook)
Guesty	✅	✅	Yes
Tokeet	✅	✅	Yes
Beds24	✅	✅	Yes

This would allow live syncing of base price, availability, and discounts.

✅ What I Can Offer Now

Script 1: Manual Price Entry for Replit

// static/pricing.json
{
  "updated": "2025-05-25",
  "airbnbRates": {
    "knp": 431,
    "knp1": 119,
    "knp3": 70
  }
}

Script 2: Updated Smart Rate Logic (loads from JSON)

import pricing from '../static/pricing.json';

export function getSmartPrice(listingId: string, checkinDate: string): { base: number, direct: number, label: string } {
  const base = pricing.airbnbRates[listingId];
  const today = new Date();
  const checkin = new Date(checkinDate);
  const days = Math.ceil((checkin.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const discount = days <= 3 ? 0.15 : 0.10;
  const direct = +(base * (1 - discount)).toFixed(2);
  const label = days <= 3 ? "15% Off – Last Minute" : "10% Off – Book Direct";
  return { base, direct, label };
}

🧪 Test Output Example

Room: KNP1 (Master Suite)
Airbnb Rate: $119
Direct Rate (5 days out): $107.10

✅ Recommendation

For now, let’s treat Airbnb’s Sunday–Tuesday rate as gospel, update it weekly (or daily via admin if needed), and let your Replit site always show pricing derived from the lowest published price.

Would you like me to:
	•	Build a small admin panel on Replit to update those base prices via a form?
	•	Generate a Google Sheet sync to Replit script?
	•	Or create a Bubble CMS block where you or a VA can plug these rates weekly?

Let’s make this foolproof — you’re almost there.
