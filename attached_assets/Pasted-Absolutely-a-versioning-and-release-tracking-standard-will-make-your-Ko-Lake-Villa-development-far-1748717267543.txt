Absolutely — a versioning and release tracking standard will make your Ko Lake Villa development far more structured, testable, and scalable, especially as you add features like Guesty, analytics, and multi-language support.

Here’s what I recommend Replit Assistant implement for you:

⸻

✅ Versioning & Release Notes Strategy

🧱 1. Semantic Versioning Standard (SemVer)

Use this format:

v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]-[stage]

Examples:
v1.2.0-production
v1.3.1-dev
v2.0.0-beta

Version	Meaning
MAJOR	Breaking changes (e.g. Gallery structure overhaul, new booking engine)
MINOR	New features (e.g. video support, Guesty sync)
PATCH	Bug fixes or backend tweaks
Stage	dev / beta / prod (optional)


⸻

🗂️ 2. Tracking in Admin Dashboard

Replit Assistant should implement:

// client/src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx

const VersionInfo = () => (
  <Card className="mt-4">
    <CardHeader>📌 Current Version</CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      <p><strong>Frontend:</strong> v1.3.2</p>
      <p><strong>Backend:</strong> v1.1.4</p>
      <p><strong>Release Notes:</strong> Added video gallery, fixed newsletter POST error</p>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 31 May 2025</p>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
);

Stored in Firebase or .env JSON:

{
  "frontendVersion": "v1.3.2",
  "backendVersion": "v1.1.4",
  "releaseNotes": [
    "✅ Video support in gallery",
    "🔧 Newsletter POST endpoint fixed",
    "🛠️ Improved AI button UI"
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-05-31"
}


⸻

🛠️ 3. Git Tagging for Replit Deployments

Ask Replit to run this after a stable deployment:

git tag -a v1.3.2 -m "🚀 Video gallery, newsletter fix, AI button UX"
git push origin v1.3.2


⸻

📣 4. Release Notes Location
	•	Auto-populate in Admin Dashboard
	•	Show a changelog in /about or /releases
	•	Optional: Include a “What’s New” toast/banner for staff

📝 Instructions for Replit Assistant

Please implement a versioning and release tracking module:
	1.	Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) like v1.3.2-prod.
	2.	Track frontendVersion, backendVersion, and releaseNotes in a new JSON file (version.json) in /public or a small Firestore collection.
	3.	Display this on the Admin Dashboard under “Current Version”.
	4.	Add a git tag during production deployment with the version string.
	5.	Optionally show a “What’s New” banner if the version changes.

This will help our team:
	•	Track deployments
	•	Communicate release changes
	•	Debug production regressions
