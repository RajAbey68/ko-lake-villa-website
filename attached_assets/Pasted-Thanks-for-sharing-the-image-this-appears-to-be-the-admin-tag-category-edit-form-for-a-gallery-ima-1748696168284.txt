Thanks for sharing the image — this appears to be the admin tag/category edit form for a gallery image. Based on the UI and issues you’ve noted, here’s a breakdown of key UX and functionality flaws plus next-step recommendations:

⸻

🔍 What’s Not Working or Confusing

1. 🏷️ Tags Cannot Be Edited or Removed Easily
	•	You typed "beach, sunset, relaxing" into Additional Tags.
	•	But there’s no way to remove individual tags once saved — no visible “x” on each tag.
	•	Issue: Input appears static after save. No feedback. Not tokenized properly.

✅ Fix Recommendation:
Replace with a multi-tag component like:

import { TagsInput } from "@components/ui/tags-input"  // example or custom chip input

Let users:
	•	Add tags dynamically
	•	See them as chips
	•	Remove with x

⸻

2. 🧠 AI Suggestion Button Missing
	•	You have AI image insight functionality, but there’s no visible button to invoke it.

✅ Fix Recommendation:
	•	Add a “Suggest Tags with AI” button beside the tags field.
	•	Optional: On image upload, auto-suggest from AI based on category.

Example UX:

<Button onClick={handleAISuggestTags}>✨ Suggest Tags</Button>

3. 📂 Category Cannot Be Easily Changed
	•	The dropdown is present, but:
	•	There’s no visual cue that changing it will reset or update tags.
	•	Doesn’t show dependencies or lock state.
	•	May be disabled on existing records unless manually reset in DB.

✅ Fix Recommendation:
	•	Enable category switching unless tied to image locking.
	•	Trigger onCategoryChange to:
	•	Re-validate tags
	•	Reset defaultTag if needed

⸻

4. 🟠 “Category will be automatically included” Message is Unclear
	•	It’s a passive message with no visibility into which tag is system-generated.
	•	If the UI adds “triple-room” silently, users can’t see or trust it.

✅ Fix Recommendation:
	•	Add #triple-room visibly but greyed out with (auto) badge.
	•	Tooltip: “Tag auto-included from category”

⸻

🔧 Recommended Changes to UI Logic

🔄 Refactor GalleryEditDialog.tsx or similar:
	•	Use a chip-style tag input (allow add/remove)
	•	Auto-include category as the first tag (visibly shown)
	•	Add “AI Tag Suggestion” button
	•	Validate that the category is from GALLERY_CATEGORIES
	•	Reorder field logic: Category → Title → Tags → Description

Would you like me to:
	1.	Patch the React form logic and send updated JSX/TSX?
	2.	Write a Playwright test for gallery tag editing?
	3.	Bundle this into your next admin UI upgrade sprint?

Let’s fix this cleanly.
