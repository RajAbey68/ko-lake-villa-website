Absolutely. Below are prompts you can use in your deployment scripts, automated workflows, or even team checklists to prevent data corruption or accidental deletion in live Replit environments.

✅ Preventative Prompts for Scripts, Teams, and Automation

🧠 Prompts for Developer Use Before Running Automation
	1.	“Are you sure this change is production-ready?”
	•	Purpose: Mental check before pushing changes.
	•	Use in UI or CLI confirmation before automation runs.
	2.	“Has the current environment been backed up?”
	•	Action Item: Trigger a snapshot/export before continuing.
	•	Add this prompt in any automated deployment interface.
	3.	“Have tests passed in the staging environment?”
	•	Purpose: Block if no staging confirmation.
	•	Tie to CI/CD test report success.
	4.	“Have you reviewed which files will be modified or deleted?”
	•	Action: Generate a diff summary of pending file changes.
	•	Alert for any modification to /data/, /db/, or similar critical folders.
	5.	“Did someone else review and approve this deployment?”
	•	Use case: GitOps, team workflows.
	•	Require one other team member to verify and approve.

🔐 Prompts for Automations & Script Guards

Add these as interactive CLI prompts or pre-check conditions before proceeding with a live update.

read -p "Are you deploying to production? Type 'yes' to continue: " confirm
if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then
  echo "Aborting deployment."
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "./backup/$(date +%F)-backup.zip" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ No backup found for today's deployment."
  echo "Please create a backup before proceeding."
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$ENV" == "production" ] && [ "$FORCE_DEPLOY" != "true" ]; then
  echo "🔒 Live environment detected. Use FORCE_DEPLOY=true to override with caution."
  exit 1
fi

📝 Prompts for Team Checklists

Post these in Slack, Notion, GitHub PR templates, or internal documentation:
	1.	✅ Has the change been tested in staging?
	2.	✅ Is the latest backup stored offsite?
	3.	✅ Have critical environment variables been verified?
	4.	✅ Have you confirmed that no data-layer files (*.db, /uploads/, etc.) are being modified?
	5.	✅ Have you announced the deployment window to the team?

🛡️ Safety Nets (Prompt Concepts Built into Scripts)
	•	Dry Run Mode:
“Previewing changes only. No files will be modified until dry-run is removed.”
	•	Critical File Change Alert:
“You are about to overwrite ‘users.db’. Are you absolutely sure?”
	•	Environment Confirmation:
“This is PRODUCTION. You are about to make live changes.”
	•	Rate-Limit Deployment:
“Another deployment occurred within the last 15 minutes. Cooldown in effect.”

🧰 Where to Implement These Prompts

Context	Implementation
Replit Bash Console	Add to run.sh or custom deployment scripts
CI/CD Pipelines	GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or shell step
Git Hooks	pre-push, pre-commit checks
Web UIs	Custom prompt modals (Replit GUI/Buttons)
Slack or Discord	/deploy slash command with confirmation prompts

Would you like me to generate a ready-to-use shell script or GitHub Action template with these prompts built in? I can also convert this guide into a web dashboard if you prefer a GUI-driven experience.
