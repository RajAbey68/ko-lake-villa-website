You’re likely dealing with a client-side caching issue — a common cause when your backend or static frontend files are updated, but the browser keeps showing the old version. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fix it completely:

⸻

✅ 1. Force Refresh in Your Browser

Try a hard reload:
	•	Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
	•	Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R

This bypasses the browser cache and reloads all assets.

⸻

✅ 2. Clear Site Cache for Your Replit App

Chrome:
	1.	Open your deployed app:
https://skill-bridge-rajabey68.replit.app/
	2.	Press F12 to open DevTools
	3.	Right-click the refresh 🔄 icon
Select “Empty Cache and Hard Reload”

⸻

✅ 3. Add Cache-Busting Logic (HTML/JS)

For persistent fixes (especially when updating components in production):

In your HTML template or JS import links, add a version hash:

<script src="/static/main.js?v=20240525"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/styles.css?v=20240525">

This forces the browser to reload updated versions.

⸻

✅ 4. Disable Service Worker (If Used)

If you’ve ever added a service worker for offline caching (PWA behavior), it may still serve cached files.

To disable:
	1.	Open Chrome DevTools
	2.	Go to Application → Service Workers
	3.	Check “Bypass for network”
	4.	Reload the page

⸻

✅ 5. Replit Workspace Refresh

In your Replit workspace:
	•	Click “Stop”
	•	Wait 10 seconds
	•	Click “Run” again

Then try your deployed URL again.

⸻

✅ 6. Add Flask Cache-Control Headers (Optional)

For static assets or routes in Flask, disable caching by adding:

from flask import make_response

@app.after_request
def add_header(response):
    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-store'
    return response

This ensures each HTTP response forces a fresh version.

⸻

✅ Confirm It’s Fixed

Once you’ve done the above, confirm that:
	•	The red box or content now appears in the Dashboard
	•	Your updates to the control page reflect immediately
	•	No console errors appear on F12 DevTools → Console

⸻

Would you like me to:
	•	Add cache headers to your Flask app?
	•	Rewrite your /dashboard route to load cleanly and show all components explicitly?

Just say the word — I’ll build it in.
