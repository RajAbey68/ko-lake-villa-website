Prompt:
You are updating the Ko Lake Villa website hosted at https://kolake-villa.RajAbey68.replit.app. The landing page has regressed and is currently missing key visual and navigation elements that were previously present.

Your task is to restore the full landing experience and enhance the gallery using media from a reference site.

2. Restore Hero Image or Header Visual

	‚Ä¢	If the original image is unavailable, use one from the gallery source below (see Task 3).
