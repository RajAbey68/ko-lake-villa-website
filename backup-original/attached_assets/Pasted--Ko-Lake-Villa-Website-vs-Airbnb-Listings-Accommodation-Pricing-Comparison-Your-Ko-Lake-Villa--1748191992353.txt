### Key Benefits of Booking Direct via Ko Lake Villa Website

- **Guaranteed Lower Rates:** Guests save 10% per night compared to Airbnb prices for the same accommodation.
- **Transparent Pricing:** The website highlights the price advantage, making the savings clear and immediate.
- **No Third-Party Fees:** Booking direct often means fewer service fees and more flexible communication.

### Positioning vs Airbnb

- **Value Proposition:** Your website now directly undercuts Airbnb on price, which is a strong motivator for price-sensitive travellers and families.
- **Guest Experience:** By booking directly, guests can often access better communication, potential for direct upgrades, or additional perks not available through third-party platforms.
- **SEO and Marketing:** Emphasising the 10% savings on your accommodation page supports your SEO and direct booking strategy, helping you compete effectively with Airbnb and similar platforms[21].

### Additional Observations

- **Accommodation Quality:** Both your website and Airbnb listings offer premium, well-reviewed villa accommodations in desirable locations, with features like private pools, spacious living areas, and family-friendly amenities[2][4].
- **Competitive Landscape:** Many villas in your region on Airbnb highlight luxury, privacy, and convenience, but do not always offer direct price incentives. Your 10% direct booking discount is a clear differentiator.

### Summary

Your Ko Lake Villa website now offers all main accommodation types at a 10% discount compared to their Airbnb rates, giving guests a compelling reason to book direct. This strategy positions your website as the best-value option for the same premium accommodation, supporting increased direct bookings and guest loyalty[21].

**For best results, ensure your website clearly advertises these savings and streamlines the direct booking process.**
