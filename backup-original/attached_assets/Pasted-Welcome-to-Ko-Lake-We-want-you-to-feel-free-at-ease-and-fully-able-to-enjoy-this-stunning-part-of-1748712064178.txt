Welcome to Ko Lake! We want you to feel free, at ease, and fully able to enjoy this stunning part of Sri Lanka. To keep the good vibes flowing for everyone — guests, staff, and our neighbours — here are a few simple guidelines:

⸻

 1.⁠ ⁠Respect Each Other
This is your home during your stay. Treat it — and those in it — with kindness and care. Harassment, threatening behaviour, or lewd conduct will not be tolerated. Anyone crossing the line may be asked to leave without a refund.

 2.⁠ ⁠Safety Comes First
Play, swim, dance, drink — but stay safe. Be mindful around the pool, fire, and sharp edges. Please watch children at all times. If something breaks, let us know — no judgement, just honesty.

 3.⁠ ⁠Be Good to the Villa
This space has been crafted with love. Don’t rearrange or remove furniture. If something is out of place, we’ll happily help.

 4.⁠ ⁠Illicit Substances
Drugs and illegal substances are a no-go. If it becomes an issue, we’ll need to involve local authorities. We’ll always cooperate fully if asked to.

 5.⁠ ⁠Noise & Nightlife
Have fun — just be mindful of your surroundings. We encourage good music, great company, and the occasional late night — as long as it doesn’t disturb other guests or the village. After 10:30 PM, please keep things low-key.

 6.⁠ ⁠Visitors & Gatherings
Friends are welcome — but large groups or parties need to be discussed with us first. Respect the space and those sharing it.

 7.⁠ ⁠Food & Drink
We’d love you to try our chef’s creations — but you’re free to bring your own favourites too. Just let us know ahead, especially for storage or preparation help.

 8.⁠ ⁠Staff & Privacy
Our team is here to help. Please treat them with warmth and courtesy. They have clear working hours and private spaces — please respect those boundaries.

 9.⁠ ⁠Damage & Repairs
Things happen. If something gets damaged, just tell us. We’ll sort it quickly and fairly.

10.⁠ ⁠Wildlife & Nature
You’re in a jungle-lake paradise. Monkeys, birds, geckos, and other visitors might pop in. Don’t feed them, and don’t leave food out. Keep doors and windows closed when away.
