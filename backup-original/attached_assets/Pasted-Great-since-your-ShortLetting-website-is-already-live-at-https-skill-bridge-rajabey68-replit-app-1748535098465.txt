Great â€” since your ShortLetting website is already live at https://skill-bridge-rajabey68.replit.app/, Iâ€™ll generate a Replit Agent prompt to help you integrate it with your SirVoy account using their API or iCal (depending on what level of control you need).

Before I finalize the prompt, Iâ€™ll make a few reasonable assumptions based on standard use cases â€” but please feel free to correct or update any of these:

Prompt for Replit Agent

Build an integration for my existing live website https://skill-bridge-rajabey68.replit.app/, which is a ShortLetting web app, to connect it with the SirVoy booking platform using their API or iCal.

Key Requirements:

	â€¢	Authenticate using my SirVoy API Key (this will be manually added to .env).
	â€¢	Fetch and display:
	â€¢	Current room availability
	â€¢	Upcoming bookings
	â€¢	Booking details (e.g., guest name, check-in/out dates)
	â€¢	Optionally support creating or confirming bookings from the website.
	â€¢	Use Replitâ€™s online hosting (already deployed).
	â€¢	Style the interface in a minimalist and user-friendly way.
	â€¢	Add optional feature: send email alerts when a new booking is created.

Preferences:
	â€¢	Platform: Web
	â€¢	Hosting: Replit
	â€¢	Operating Mode: Online
	â€¢	Language (Agent Interaction): English
	â€¢	Language (App Interface): English
