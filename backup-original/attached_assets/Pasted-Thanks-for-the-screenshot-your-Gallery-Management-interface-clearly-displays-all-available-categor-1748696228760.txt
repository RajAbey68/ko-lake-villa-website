Thanks for the screenshot — your Gallery Management interface clearly displays all available categories, but here’s what I’m seeing based on your note and visual:

⸻

❗ Current Issues

1. 🎯 Category Buttons Are Not Working (Unclickable or No Filtering)

Observed: Clicking on a category (e.g. Family Suite, Dining Area) has no visible effect.

Likely Causes:
	•	The buttons are not triggering the filtering logic
	•	onClick handler might not be mapped
	•	activeCategory state not being passed to the gallery display component
	•	CSS or layout issue hiding the filtered results

✅ Fix Recommendation:
Make sure each button is bound like this:

<button
  key={category.value}
  className={activeCategory === category.value ? 'active' : ''}
  onClick={() => setActiveCategory(category.value)}
>
  {category.label}
</button>

Then filter:

const filteredImages = activeCategory
  ? images.filter((img) => img.category === activeCategory)
  : images;

2. 🎥 No Videos Showing in Gallery

You’ve uploaded videos but:
	•	They don’t show up in Admin
	•	No thumbnails or media previews
	•	Possibly not parsed/displayed due to mediaType !== 'video'

✅ Fix Recommendation:
In your Gallery rendering logic:

{image.mediaType === 'video' ? (
  <video controls>
    <source src={image.imageUrl} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
) : (
  <img src={image.imageUrl} alt={image.alt} />
)}

Also ensure the upload logic:
	•	Accepts video/mp4 MIME types
	•	Saves mediaType: 'video' to DB

✅ Suggested Improvements

Area	Issue	Fix
Category Buttons	No filtering or UI response	Hook onClick to state + filtering logic
Video Support	Not rendered or differentiated	Conditional rendering <video> tag
UX Feedback	No “No images for this category” message	Add fallback message when filtered list is empty
Tag Editing	No interactive input	Use chip/token tag input
AI Button Missing	AI suggestion tool not accessible	Add ✨ Suggest Tags trigger

Would you like me to now:
	1.	Generate a React/TSX patch for category filtering and video support?
	2.	Add a Playwright test to verify video playback in gallery?
	3.	Push these to your Replit Git integration or as a .patch file?

Let’s tighten this admin UX so it’s functional and guest-ready.
