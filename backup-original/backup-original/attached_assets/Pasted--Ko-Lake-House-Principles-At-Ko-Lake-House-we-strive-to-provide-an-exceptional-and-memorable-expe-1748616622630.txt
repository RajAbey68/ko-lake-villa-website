(Facebook, Insta, Google, OTAs, influencers, etc.?) •	How is the budget/USD 1000 split?
(Content creation vs. actual paid ads—photos, videos, creatives?)
Who  are we targeting?
(Adventure travelers, digital nomads, groups—local or international markets?)
 How long will the campaign run? …all 300K on one month hand 100k next month
(Daily/weekly spend breakdown to stretch the budget?)
 Is the goal or call-to-action?
(Direct bookings via WhatsApp, website visits, partner with OTA clicks, )
 Any retargeting or audience-building planned?
