Absolutely ‚Äî below is a full Replit JavaScript script that:
	1.	Updates your /accommodation page to match the correct room names and structure.
	2.	Applies the agreed direct booking discount logic (10% normally, 15% within 3 days).
	3.	Tests for display accuracy between the rendered room names and your official naming structure.

‚úÖ Full Replit Script for /accommodation Page

This script assumes you‚Äôre using vanilla JS + HTML or EJS in Replit with static/dynamic rendering.

‚∏ª

üì¶ Step 1: Room Data (Replace in rooms.js or accommodation.js)

// Ko Lake Villa ‚Äì Official Room Definitions & Pricing Logic

const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const getDirectPrice = (airbnbPrice, checkinDateStr) => {
  const checkinDate = new Date(checkinDateStr);
  checkinDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  const diffInDays = Math.ceil((checkinDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const discount = diffInDays <= 3 ? 0.15 : 0.10;
  const directPrice = (airbnbPrice * (1 - discount)).toFixed(2);
  const label = diffInDays <= 3 ? "Last-Minute Deal (15% Off)" : "Direct Booking (10% Off)";
  return { directPrice, label };
};

const rooms = [
  {
    name: "Entire Villa Exclusive (KNP)",
    slug: "knp",
    airbnbPrice: 1800,
    capacity: "16++ guests (up to 25)",
    features: ["All 7 rooms", "60-ft pool", "Rooftop terrace", "Lakefront view"],
    link: "https://airbnb.co.uk/h/knp",
    checkinDate: "2025-06-05"
  },
  {
    name: "Master Family Suite (KNP1)",
    slug: "knp1",
    airbnbPrice: 450,
    capacity: "6 guests",
    features: ["Lake views", "Master suite", "Pool access"],
    link: "https://airbnb.co.uk/h/knp1",
    checkinDate: "2025-06-05"
  },
  {
    name: "Triple/Twin Rooms (KNP3)",
    slug: "knp3",
    airbnbPrice: 180,
    capacity: "3 guests per room (4 rooms)",
    features: ["Flexible bedding", "Garden views", "Shared amenities"],
    link: "https://airbnb.co.uk/h/knp3",
    checkinDate: "2025-06-05"
  },
  {
    name: "Group Room (KNP6)",
    slug: "knp6",
    airbnbPrice: 250,
    capacity: "4 guests",
    features: ["Team layout", "Communal space", "Shared access"],
    link: "Coming Soon",
    checkinDate: "2025-06-05"
  }
];

// Add dynamic pricing to each room
rooms.forEach(room => {
  const { directPrice, label } = getDirectPrice(room.airbnbPrice, room.checkinDate);
  room.directPrice = directPrice;
  room.discountLabel = label;
});

module.exports = rooms;


‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Accommodation Page HTML/EJS Renderer (e.g., in accommodation.ejs)

<% rooms.forEach(room => { %>
  <div class="room-card">
    <h3><%= room.name %></h3>
    <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> <%= room.capacity %></p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> <%= room.features.join(', ') %></p>
    <p><strong>Airbnb Rate:</strong> $<%= room.airbnbPrice %>/night</p>
    <p><strong><%= room.discountLabel %>:</strong> <span style="color: green;">$<%= room.directPrice %>/night</span></p>
    <p><a href="<%= room.link %>" target="_blank">View on Airbnb</a></p>
  </div>
<% }) %>

üß™ Step 3: Display Match Test Script (for console or dev debug)

// Debug checker for room name integrity
const expectedNames = [
  "Entire Villa Exclusive (KNP)",
  "Master Family Suite (KNP1)",
  "Triple/Twin Rooms (KNP3)",
  "Group Room (KNP6)"
];

const roomTest = rooms.every((room, idx) => room.name === expectedNames[idx]);

if (!roomTest) {
  console.error("üö® Room name mismatch detected! Please verify room array order or names.");
} else {
  console.log("‚úÖ Room names match official structure.");
}


‚∏ª

‚úÖ What This Script Does
	‚Ä¢	Updates names and features to match your official room descriptions
	‚Ä¢	Calculates dynamic pricing based on check-in date
	‚Ä¢	Renders both Airbnb rate and direct price with discount label
	‚Ä¢	Runs a test to ensure the displayed names match the authoritative room list

‚∏ª

Would you like me to generate this as:
	‚Ä¢	A single .js file with Express routing?
	‚Ä¢	An integrated .ejs frontend + Replit JSON/JS backend combo?
	‚Ä¢	Or connected to Firebase for real-time date-based pricing?

Let me know how you‚Äôre structuring the backend, and I‚Äôll wire it up perfectly.
