That’s an excellent idea — using semantic versioning (vX.Y.Z) and release notes is the best practice for communicating changes across both your public-facing site and your admin console.

✅ Versioning Strategy: Semantic Versioning

Use this format:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Version Type	Use Case Examples
MAJOR (X)	Large changes that break backward compatibility (e.g. new booking engine, redesigned gallery, AI model upgrade)
MINOR (Y)	New features that are additive and backward-compatible (e.g. new analytics panel, image compression added)
PATCH (Z)	Bug fixes, security updates, or small UI improvements

🔖 Where to Tag the Version

Add version tags to both your public and admin pages in the footer:

<footer class="container">
  <small>
    Ko Lake Villa v1.3.0 • 
    <a href="https://github.com/RajAbey68/ko-lake-villa-website/releases/tag/v1.3.0" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>
  </small>
</footer>

🔐 If you’re keeping notes private, link to:
	•	GitHub Releases (private repo): Good if you want full version control
	•	Replit deployment changelog: Good for team-only visibility

⸻

🚀 Git Tagging Workflow (Optional)

If you’re using GitHub:

# Tag a version
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Added image compression tools and bug fixes"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.3.0

Then create a release on GitHub with a changelog.

🔧 Optional Enhancement

Would you like me to:
	•	Build a versioned release notes HTML page?
	•	Add footer versioning + release link to your HTML layout?
	•	Set up a GitHub Action to auto-tag versions on merge to main?

Let me know and I’ll generate the code or tooling to automate it for you.
