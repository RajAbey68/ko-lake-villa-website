# Replit Agent Budget Protection Setup

## Immediate Steps to Prevent Overcharges:

1. **Set Usage Alerts**
   - Go to your Replit account settings
   - Navigate to billing/usage section
   - Set alerts at 50%, 75%, 90% of desired monthly limit

2. **Configure Hard Budget Limit**
   - Set a monthly budget that acts as hard limit
   - Service will suspend if limit reached
   - Better to lose temporary access than unlimited charges

3. **Monitor Usage Frequently**
   - Check usage page regularly
   - Remember: 25 cents per checkpoint (file change)
   - Credits: Core ($25/month), Teams ($40/month per user)

- Agent doesn't follow explicit instructions
- Working on different features/tasks
