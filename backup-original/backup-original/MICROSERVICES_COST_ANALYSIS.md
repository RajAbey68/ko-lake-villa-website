# Microservices Architecture - Cost & Implementation Analysis
## Ko Lake Villa Website Migration

## Container & Infrastructure Costs

### Current Monolithic Setup (Replit)
- **Cost**: ~$20/month for Replit deployment
- **Resources**: Single container, shared CPU/memory
- **Scaling**: Limited, entire app scales together

### Microservices Container Costs

#### Option 1: Google Cloud Run (Recommended)
**Per Service Costs:**
- Content Service: $5-15/month (low traffic)
- Media Service: $10-25/month (image processing)
- Booking Service: $8-20/month (moderate usage)
- Auth Service: $3-8/month (minimal usage)
- Notification Service: $2-5/month (email only)

**Total Estimated**: $28-73/month
- **Pay-per-use**: Only charged when services are active
- **Auto-scaling**: Scales to zero when not used
- **No minimum fees**: Good for boutique hotel traffic

#### Option 2: Docker Containers on VPS
**DigitalOcean/Linode:**
- Small droplet: $12/month (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU)
- Medium droplet: $24/month (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU)
- Container orchestration: Docker Compose (free)

**Total Estimated**: $12-24/month
- **Fixed cost**: Regardless of usage
- **Manual scaling**: Requires monitoring
- **More management**: Server maintenance needed

#### Option 3: AWS ECS Fargate
**Per Service:**
- CPU: $0.04048/vCPU/hour
- Memory: $0.004445/GB/hour
- Estimated: $40-80/month for all services

### Storage Costs (Additional)

#### Database Services
- **Google Cloud SQL**: $7-15/month (small instance)
- **AWS RDS**: $13-25/month (micro instance)
- **Supabase**: $25/month (includes auth service)

#### File Storage
- **Google Cloud Storage**: $0.02/GB/month
- **AWS S3**: $0.023/GB/month
- **Firebase Storage**: $0.026/GB/month

### Development & Deployment Costs

#### Container Registry
- **Google Container Registry**: $0.10/GB/month
- **AWS ECR**: $0.10/GB/month
- **Docker Hub**: Free for public, $5/month private

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: 2000 minutes/month free
- **Google Cloud Build**: 120 builds/day free
- **Additional**: $0.003/build minute

## Cost Comparison Summary

### Current vs Microservices (Monthly)
```
Current Monolith:     $20
Microservices (GCR):  $50-90
Microservices (VPS):  $35-50
```

## Implementation Caveats

### Technical Complexity
- **Service Communication**: API calls between services add latency
- **Data Consistency**: Distributed transactions more complex
- **Monitoring**: Need centralized logging and metrics
- **Development**: More repositories and deployment pipelines

### Operational Overhead
- **Container Management**: Docker expertise required
- **Service Discovery**: Need load balancers or service mesh
- **Security**: More attack surfaces to secure
- **Backup Strategy**: Multiple databases to backup

### Network Costs
- **Inter-service calls**: Can add up with high traffic
- **Load balancer fees**: $18-25/month for managed LB
- **CDN costs**: $1-5/month for image delivery

## Recommended Migration Path

### Phase 1: Extract Media Service ($15-20 additional/month)
- Lowest risk, highest isolation benefit
- Handle gallery uploads independently
- Test microservices patterns

### Phase 2: Separate Content Management ($10-15 additional/month)
- Independent CMS updates
- Better content deployment velocity

### Phase 3: Booking Service Extraction ($15-25 additional/month)
- Integrate with external booking platforms
- Handle reservation logic separately

### Total Migration Cost: $40-60/month additional

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Start with Cloud Run**: Pay-per-use model for low traffic
2. **Shared Databases**: Keep some services on same DB initially
3. **Gradual Migration**: Extract one service at a time
4. **Container Optimization**: Use multi-stage builds, smaller images
5. **Caching Strategy**: Redis for shared data, reduce API calls

## Break-even Analysis
- **Current inefficiency**: Full app restarts for small changes
- **Development velocity**: Faster deployments worth $20-30/month
- **Reliability**: Independent service failures worth additional cost
- **Scaling**: Pay only for resources actually used

The microservices approach makes financial sense if development velocity and reliability improvements justify the additional $40-60/month operational cost.
